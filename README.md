# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the ride-sharing business, PyBer, with 3 business recommendations in regard to the correlation between ride-sharing fees and the type of city in which customers live. Using analysis tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib, the following report summarizes ride-sharing data across 3 different types of cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

## Results
### Average Fares by City Type

From this chart, we can gather that Urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers thus providing the most revenue. It is also notable that Urban cities charged less than suburban and Rural cities. Suburban cities had significantly lower total fares but they also had a lower number of drivers and rides. Rural cities had the least number of total fares, rides, and drivers, resulting in the highest fare averages per ride and driver.

### Total Fare by City Type

There is a collective rise in Total Fares nearing the end of February and the beginning of March. Urban cities continuously rise and fall throughout the month of March before leveling out at a high rate from the beginning to the middle of April, then dropping off near the end of the month. Contrarily, Suburban and rural cities drop at the beginning of April after a slight increase right at the beginning of the month.

## Summary
From this analysis, we can gather the following conclusions:
1. Urban cities are the most condensed and populated, which allows for more drivers and lower fares per ride while maintaining the highest total fares by city type. Rural areas tend to cover more mileage as the cities are more spread apart. This may be a cause for higher ride fares. PyBer would be wise to consider analyzing the average mileage driven across city types to understand the cost per mileage.

2. In relation to the details covered in the previous suggestion, it would also be beneficial for PyBer to research populations across city types. There may be cities with a higher population that may have a need for more drivers than other cities. It would be helpful to understand city populations in comparison to fares and record them throughout the year to take into account tourism and vacation records.

3. Lastly, we see a spike in fares near the end of February in all city types and a fairly different pattern following through the end of April. It could be assumed that there are holidays or celebrations that are applicable across the nation and others local to a state or city. It would be wise to track ride-sharing activity and rates with holidays throughout the year.
